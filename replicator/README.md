# How to make another branch


## Background and Motivation

This is a self-replicating network.  That means you, the user, are responsible for replicating it.  This is not the same as "sharing" on existing networks.  When you share a post on a social network like Facebook, you are just moving information around on an existing, fixed network--the code of Facebook itself remains as it is, with the same number of users, same pages, same structure, etc.  But when you replicate a node in this network, you copy the *whole* thing, the entire underlying structure is copied. It would be as if every time someone made a new Facebook page, instead of doing it through Facebook, they went out and started a new company, registered a new domain, built a new code base, deployed it, got users, and then built in that.  This sounds inefficient, and in some ways it is.  But it's also powerful in a way that fixed networks are not.  If a network can completely clone itself, with no reference back to the initial code, and each instance can be edited in situ and then cloned again, it becomes like a living thing.  Replication and mutation are what make life what it is.  To build information structures that exist in the wild of the Web which have the properties of fully copying themselves and mutating in the wild is to make *organic media*, media which behaves in the most important ways like a living thing.  Once replication is able to self-propagate, that is to find new users willing to copy it and improve it without help from its initial creator, there is no way to know what will happen.  This is an experiment.
