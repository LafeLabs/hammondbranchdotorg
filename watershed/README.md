The triangle represents the geometric structure used to build useful symbols and icons in the Network.  The color blue represents water.  The open circle represents the sky from which rain falls, the curve represents the flow and the filled circle represents the sea to which all water tends to flow.  This symbol can be used to mark locations of various landmarks in the Network in the physical world.
