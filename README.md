Self-replicating(you replicate it your *self*) web page for Hammond Branch, a little creek that flows through Howard County, Maryland.  

This page is part of the Watershed Network, which is a planned global network that links all of the water that we as humans care about.  It is up to us, the participants in this network, to expand it to more streams, creeks, river, lakes, reservoirs, aquaducts, estuaries, oceans, seas, cloud patterns, water treatment plans, desalinations plants, aquifers, etc.  This is a radically decentralized network: there is no central organization, company, group, web page, or even code base for it. We, the people of the world, simply replicate these pages, change them as needed, connect them all up, and ultimately use them to organize ourselves in regards to our most precious shared resource: water.

Hammond Branch originates around the Maple Lawn turkey farm in Laurel, then joins the Middle Patuxent River south of Savage.  It's small, winding, but quite nice, going through some scenic places, and with lots of wildlife.  This page will fork down to sub-pages which deal with various features of the creek, such as bridges, tunnels, scenic places, or other noteworthy landmarks, as well as bulletin boards where people who interact with this body of water can communicate.
